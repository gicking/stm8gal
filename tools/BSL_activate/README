STM8_BSL_activate
==================

STM8 project for SDCC or Cosmic compiler which activates the ROM bootloader via option bytes.

Upload the code via SWIM using:
  - POSIX: stm8flash by Valentin Dudouyt (https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash)
  - Win:   stm8flash (see above) or ST Visual Programmer (http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm8-software-development-tools/stm8-programmers/stvp-stm8.html)

After STM8_BSL_activate has run, STM8 can also be programmed via the ROM bootloader

compile (sdcc must be in PATH):
  make [DEVICE=stm8s105|stm8s207]

upload via stm8flash (check settings; stm8flash must be in PATH)
  make [DEVICE=stm8s105|stm8s207] swim
