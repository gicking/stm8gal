# Overview

_stm8gal_ is an application for programming or reading out [STM8](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm8-8-bit-mcus.html) memory using the built-in ROM bootloader (BSL) via UART or SPI interface. It is compatible with Windows, MacOS X and Linux, including Raspbian. For a list of tested configurations see section [Test Overview](#test-overview).

Note: [_stm8gal_](https://github.com/gicking/stm8gal) replaces the [_STM8_serial_flasher_](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_serial_flasher). The latter was renamed after a [proposal by Philipp Krause](https://github.com/gicking/STM8_serial_flasher/issues/10)

Tools with similar functionality via the UART interface are:
- [_Flash Loader Demonstrator (UM0462)_](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm8-software-development-tools/stm8-programmers/flasher-stm8.html) by STM (proprietary, Windows only)
- [_stm8flasher_](http://sourceforge.net/p/oggstreamer/stm8flasher) by ottinger (open-source, Windows & Linux)
- [_stm-serial-flasher_](https://github.com/Gamadril/stm-serial-flasher) by gamadril (open-source, Chrome)

For bug reports or feature requests please send me a note.

Have fun!

# Building the Software

The majority of _stm8gal_ is written in ISO C 99 with some OS-specific routines required e.g. for serial communication. However the required serial libs are part of all standard compiler suites and shouldn't pose a compatibility issue. In case of portability issues please contact the author for support.

Non ANSI-C extensions:

- [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) library, which is [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) specific, and allows automatic reset of the STM8 via GPIO header pin. Is pre-installed for Raspbian Stretch and above. To activate remove comment in Makefile

- [spidev](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/spi/spidev) kernel library for interfacing to the SPI. To activate remove comment in Makefile. The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and other "embedded PCs" provide direct SPI pin access, so no extra hardware is required. For "normal" PCs, an extra hardware and likely an adaptation of the SPI send/receive routines is required (volunteers?)

A code reference can be generated by running [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) with input file 'Doxyfile'. Then open file './doxygen/html/index.html' with a webbrowser. For other output formats, e.g. PDF, modify 'Doxyfile' accordingly.

***

## Linux

Use one of the following options to build _stm8gal_:
- Open a terminal and change to the project directory. Then type `make`
- Alternatively double-click file "\_compile.sh". May require execute permissions via `chmod u+x *.sh`
- in [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) open project "stm8gal.geany"and make (Shift+F9)
- for SPI communication via supported SPI adapter (untested!):
  - requires installed `spidev` and user access to SPI hardware
  - specify `CFLAGS += -DUSE\_SPIDEV` and `SOURCES += spi\_spidev\_comm.c` in file "Makefile"

Note: Under Linux access to serial ports may be prohibited. To grant access rights see [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtkterm/+bug/949597)

***

## Raspberry Pi

Same as Linux above, but with additional option:
- for reset STM8 via GPIO header:
  - specify `-DUSE\_WIRING` and `-lwiringPi` in file "Makefile"
  - if required install [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/). To check type `gpio readall` in commandline
  - enable GPIO access via `raspi-config`
  - add user to group gpio (`sudo usermod -a -G gpio $(whoami)`)
- for UART communication via GPIO header:
  - enable serial interface access via `raspi-config`
  - add user to group dialout (`sudo usermod -a -G dialout $(whoami)`)
- for SPI communication via GPIO header:
  - install spidev if required (is pre-installed for Raspbian Stretch and above)
  - specify `CFLAGS += -DUSE\_SPIDEV` and `SOURCES += spi\_spidev\_comm.c` in file "Makefile"
  - enable SPI access via `raspi-config`
  - add user to group spi (`sudo usermod -a -G spi $(whoami)`)

***

## Windows

Use one of the following options to build _stm8gal_:
- in [DevC++](http://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) open project "stm8gal.dev" and build all (F12)
- in [Microsoft Visual C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=vs-2019) open project "MSVC" and build all
- in File Explorer double-click file "\_compile.bat". Requires gcc and mingw32-make to be installed and in PATH. May require some modifications to the batchfile and file Makefile

Note: Windows commandline (cmd.exe) requires a path on a mounted drive, i.e. path to the tool has to start with 'C:\', 'D:\' or similar. So either copy the tool to a mounted drive or use 'connect network drive' to assign a drive letter. This limitation does not apply to POSIX operating systems

***

## MacOSX

Same as for Linux above. However, for double-click rename files "*.sh" to "*.command"

Note: Due to lack of a Macintosh, compatibility with MacOSX is no longer tested. Therefore, please provide feedback if you have experience with _stm8gal_ on a Mac. Also a Mac binary for distribution is highly appreciated. Thanks!

# Using the Software

_stm8gal_ is a commandline tool without graphical interface (volunteers...?). The application is called from the command line or via shell script using the below syntax.

`usage: stm8gal with following options/commands:`

    -h/-help                        print this help
    -v/-verbose [level]             set verbosity level 0..3 (default: 2)
    -B/-background                  skip prompts and colors for background operation (default: foreground)
    -q/-exit-prompt                 prompt for <return> prior to exit (default: no prompt)
    -R/-reset [rst]                 reset for STM8: 0=skip, 1=manual, 2=DTR line (RS232), 3=send 'Re5eT!' @ 115.2kBaud, 4=Arduino pin pin 8, 5=Raspi pin 12, 6=RTS line (RS232) (default: manual)
    -i/-interface [line]            communication interface: 0=UART, 1=SPI via Arduino, 2=SPI via spidev (default: UART)
    -u/-uart-mode [mode]            UART mode: 0=duplex, 1=1-wire, 2=2-wire reply, other=auto-detect (default: auto-detect)
    -p/-port [name]                 communication port (default: list available ports)
    -b/-baudrate [speed]            communication baudrate in Baud (default: 115200)
    -V/-verify [method]             verify flash content after upload: 0=skip, 1=CRC32 checksum, 2=read-back (default: read-back)
    -j/-jump-addr [address]         jump to address (as dec or hex) before exit of stm8gal, or -1 for skip (default: flash)
    -w/-write-file [file [addr]]    upload file from PC to uController. For binary file (*.bin) with address offset (as dec or hex)
    -W/-write-byte [addr value]     change value at given address (both as dec or hex)
    -r/-read [start stop output]    read memory range (as dec or hex) and save to file or print (output=console)
    -e/-erase-sector [addr]         erase flash sector containing given address (as dec or hex). Use carefully!
    -E/-erase-full                  mass erase complete flash. Use carefully!

Notes:
  - reset via RasPi GPIO (`-R 5`) is only available on a Raspberry Pi and if _stm8gal_ was built with _wiringPi_ support (see [Building the Software](#building-the-software))
  - interface spidev (`-i 2`) is only available if _stm8gal_ was built with _spidev_ support (see [Building the Software](#building-the-software))
  - SPI via Arduino (`-i 1`) and reset via Arduino GPIO (`-R 4`) requires an additional Arduino programmed as [SPI bridge](https://github.com/gicking/Arduino_SPI_bridge)
  - to avoid address conflicts with Boot-ROM or CRC32-verify RAM routines, optional user RAM code should start at address 0x400

# Notes

- bootloader programming via UART, SPI or CAN is supported by most STM8 devices. However, not all devices support each interface. A full description of the bootloaders can be found in [UM0560](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/user_manual/CD00201192.pdf), including an overview of STM8 devices with respective bootloader mode. For _stm8gal_ >=v1.2.0 the UART mode can optionally be auto-detected:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/BSL_Modes.png">
</p>

- To program via _stm8gal_, communication between PC and STM8 must be possible. On the STM8 side this is via [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UART) or [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus), on the PC side this is generally via USB or RS232.

  - On some boards, e.g. the [_muBoard_](http://www.cream-tea.de/presentations/160305_PiAndMore.pdf), an USB<->UART bridge is already present. In this case, no additional hardware is required

  - However, e.g. the popular [STM8S Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm8s-discovery.html) and [STM8L Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm8l-discovery.html) boards connect to a standard PC via SWIM (=debug) interface. In this case a separate adapter is required to connect to the respective STM8 UART or SPI pins, e.g. [UM232R](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Modules/DS_UM232R.pdf). When connecting, make sure that the voltage levels of STM8 and the adapter are compatible. **Exposing a 3.3V device to 5V signals may damage the 3.3V device**.

  - Exception is the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) or similar “embedded PCs“ with direct access to UART and SPI pins via the GPIO header. In this case make sure that the voltage levels of STM8 and embedded PC are compatible, e.g. for RasPi with 3.3V pins also supply the STM8 with Vdd=3.3V. As noted above, **never expose a 3.3V device to 5V signals**.

  - Alternatively an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) can be used to act as a USB<->SPI bridge using a dedicated "gateway software". For the Arduino project and a technical documentation see the [Arduino SPI_bridge](https://github.com/gicking/Arduino_SPI_bridge) repository. Again, **note compatible voltage levels of Arduino and STM8**.

- Prior to uploading code via _stm8gal_ the STM8 ROM bootloader needs to be activated via option bytes. For details see the respective STM8 device datasheet. If required, change the option bytes via SWIM debug interface using

  - [ST Visual Programmer](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC961/SS1533/PF210568?s_searchtype=keyword) application by STM (proprietary, Windows only)

  - [stm8flash](https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash) by Valentin Dudouyt to upload and run the STM8 program in subfolder './BSL_activate'

  - Notes

    - Virgin devices (i.e. flash completely erased) automatically have the bootloader enabled

- The BSL can be entered only within 1s after reset or power-on. Exception are virgin devices, which remain in bootloader mode indefinitely.

- The UART "reply" mode (see above) supports single-wire interfaces like LIN or ISO9141. It requires a "Rx echo" for each sent byte. Using the reply mode with dual wires therefore requires _stm8gal_ to echo each received byte individually, which results in extremely low reading speed due to USB latency.

- SPI communication via spidev or [Arduino SPI bridge](https://github.com/gicking/Arduino_SPI_bridge) works reliably only up to 250kBaud in my test setup (see above)

- The STM32 uses a very similar bootloader protocol, so adapting the flasher tool for STM32 should be straightforward. However, I have no board available, but please feel free to go ahead...

# Test Overview

_stm8gal_ has recently been tested only for the below STM8 devices and operating systems. Theoretically it should work for all STM8 devices with bootloader, especially since STM8AF, STLUX, STNRG and STM8SPLNB seem to be test variants of the STM8S, and STM8AL and STM8T seem to be test variants of the STM8L. However, this has not been tested, so if you use _stm8gal_ in another setup, any feedback is highly appreciated!
